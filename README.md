# Project2
This repository is for ST558, Project 2, to create a Shiny app.

This application, the Mobile Device Usage App, allows you to subset and explore data about mobile device usage from 700 individual users. The dataset provides analysis of mobile usage patterns and user behavior classification. The app allows the user to explore the dataset via numeric and categorical summaries and numerous types of plots. The user can also download a CSV file of the data table generated by making selections to subset the data, if desired.
